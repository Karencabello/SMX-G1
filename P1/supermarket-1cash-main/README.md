## Supermarket Simulation (1 cashier case)

  Event driven simulation (EDS) example
  based in the code given in Jorba's book, chapter 2

  This code supports 1 cashier case following the code design of the book as similar as possible to use the book text for the learning proces. 
  However, this code introduces few modifications with respect the code in the book:

   1) The code in the book has some errors that are solved in this code (but the explanations are correct, the errors are minor implementation mistakes, but it doesn't work)
   2) It organizes the code in fuctions (the same code is divided in functions to give structure to the code)
   3) It divides the code in files (it separates these funcions in modules for better organization of the code)
   4) It provides traces to see what the program does. These traces can be turn ON and OFF

   This 1-cashier case code is only used to follow the book explanations, and to go step by step in the learning process.
   But we will use the n-cashier in the tests as it is more generic.
